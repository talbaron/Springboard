    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

In the simulation I did, I received that only 3 out of 100,000 resamples, had a difference in means as extreme or higher then the one in the original sample, under the assumption that the difference in means is in fact 0. According to these findings, we can claim with high confidence, that the original difference in means is significantly different from 0, which means that race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes."

In order to determine whether there is a more important factor in callback success, I would check for correlation between success and other factors, and the factor with the highest correlation with success (in absolute value) would be the most important factor in callback success."
